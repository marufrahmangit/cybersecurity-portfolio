# Professional Statement
---
I am Maruf Rahman. I am a Programmer, Technical Writer, and an aspiring Cybersecurity Professional with 7+ years of experience in the IT industry working with multiple technologies and tools. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology in 2017 and started my career as a software developer. Over the years, I have worked with different tools and technologies in software development and IT in general, and even managing projects/teams.

Recently, I have acquired the Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificates, ISC2 Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, and a few other training courses to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. The Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate has prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats. As of July 2024, I am preparing to take the CompTIA Security+ certifications.
