# Overview
This is a beginner-friendly step-by-step Pentesting process on a device. I will use Kali distro of the Linux OS for this process.

# Process
1. Scan a device (server, computer, phone, etc.) to look for vunerability.
2. Vunerability- loophole
3. Post exploitation- elevate privilege, gain full-control of the system, etc.

### 1. Scan a device
Use `nmap` to check for services running in the device.
* `sudo` super-user (root) access
* `-sV` service version
* `-O` operating system and version
* `-p1-65535` range of port numbers
