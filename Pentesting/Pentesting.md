# Overview
This is a beginner-friendly step-by-step Pentesting process on a device. I will use the Kali distro of the Linux operating system for this process.

# Process
1. Scan a device (server, computer, phone, etc.) for vulnerability.
2. Vulnerability- loophole
3. Post exploitation- elevate privilege, gain full control of the system, etc.

### 1. Scan a device using nmap
`sudo nmap <ip address> -sV -O -p1-65535`
* **sudo** = super-user (root) access
* **-sV** = service version
* **-O** = operating system and version
* **-p1-65535** = range of port numbers between 1 and 65535
